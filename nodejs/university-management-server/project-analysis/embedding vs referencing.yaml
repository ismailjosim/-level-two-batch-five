when our data won't group we will use embedding.
when our data scale is huge and it will continuously grow then we will reference our data with main data.

Things to remember:

ðŸ‘‰ In mongoDB we can embed maximum 16MB data. [if it's grow]
ðŸ‘‰ We can't embed growing data.
ðŸ‘‰ referencing prevent data duplication.


Pros and Const of Embedding
Pros            Cons
Faster Reading | Slow Writing
Update all data with single query | Update query can be complex
less expensive | Limited Size
Lookup | Data Duplicity

Pros and Const of Referencing
Pros            Cons
Faster Writing | Slow Reading
Avoid data duplicacy | Expensive Lookup
Scalability
